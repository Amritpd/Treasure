Treasure
========

A C++ game where the objective is to get the A to the X without touching the trees. The player gets 3 chainsaws that can be activated by pressing the letter 'c'. The chainsaws cut the trees above, below, on the left and on the right of the player's position. The program uses a basic scoring algorithm.
